        <div class='text'>
            <p>We collect the list of all colleges and universities from an online source:
                <a href="https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-colleges-and-universities/export/?flg=en-us" target="_blank">
                    https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-colleges-and-universities/export/?flg=en-us
                </a>
                The source above provides us basic information regarding every university in the country, which would come
                incredibly handy when it comes to extraction for visualisation.
                Then, we proceed to clean the data, removing all the unnecessary data columns as well as schools that are
                either inactive (-999 students) or have too small of a population (less than 1000 students) so that we can
                have the most viable dataset to work with. We then scrape the food satisfaction and quality (measured using
                various metrics, such as overall grading, number of dining halls, opening hours, etc). These two datasets will
                then be merged into one and will be used to later determine what are the factors that have the strongest
                influence on how students are feeling about their nutrition quality

                <p> First, we have a choropleth map that visualizes the average food rating across different U.S. states. 
                    Each state is shaded based on its average rating, with darker colors representing higher ratings. 
                    This map allows for a quick geographic overview of food quality by state. <br>

                    At a glance, we can see which regions generally have higher or lower food ratings. 
                    For example, states with darker shades may indicate areas with better-rated food options, 
                    while lighter shades suggest regions with lower average ratings. 
                    This visualization helps highlight potential regional trends in food quality, 
                    prompting further exploration into factors that might contribute to these differences, 
                    such as local policies, demographics, or cost of living.
                </p>
                <p class='text'> Overall, this indicates that other factors are more important in the determinance of a good food score,
                    which can include overall tuition, location, or student population over tuition change over a five year time 
                    period in particular.</p>

                <p> This plot examines the relationship between tuition costs and food ratings across schools. 
                    Each dot represents a school, with the x-axis showing the total tuition cost for in-state students 
                    living off-campus and the y-axis displaying the food rating.

                    We can see that food ratings are spread across all tuition levels, 
                    with no clear trend linking higher tuition to better food ratings. 
                    This suggests that schools with higher tuition don’t necessarily provide better-rated food options. <br>
                    
                    The visualization raises an interesting question: Do other factors, such as campus location 
                    or student preferences, play a more significant role in determining food satisfaction? 

                    Overall, this plot highlights that price alone may not dictate the quality of college food services.

                <p> These side-by-side scatter plots compare food ratings against total tuition costs for in-state students living on campus, 
                    focusing on schools over $80,000. The x-axis represents the city population, 
                    while the y-axis shows the total tuition cost. The left plot covers the 2022-2023 academic year, 
                    and the right one represents 2021-2022. <br>

                    The color-coded dots in the 2022-2023 plot represent different food rating grades, allowing us to see if higher tuition 
                    correlates with better-rated food options. However, no strong pattern emerges, as various food grades 
                    appear across the tuition range, regardless of city size. The 2021-2022 plot, though more straightforward
                    without color differentiation, similarly shows that city population doesn’t significantly impact 
                    tuition or food ratings. These plots suggest that tuition costs and city size may not be reliable 
                    indicators of food quality, highlighting the variability in factors influencing food ratings across 
                    campuses.

                <p> This bar chart displays the average food rating for each letter grade category, 
                    highlighting the difference in quality across ratings. "A+" grades, shown at the top, 
                    have the highest average rating, which suggests these establishments maintain a higher 
                    standard. In contrast, grades like "C" and "D" are notably lower, reinforcing that lower 
                    grades often correlate with lower food quality. <br>

                    The gradient color scheme visually reinforces the progression from high to low ratings, 
                    making it easy to compare categories at a glance. This visualization clearly shows how 
                    food quality decreases as the letter grade drops, providing a straightforward look into 
                    the relationship between grades and average food ratings.

                <p> This interactive scatter plot explores the relationship between food ratings and total prices for 
                    in-state students living off-campus. Each color represents a different grade, with size showing 
                    distinctions within each grade. By selecting specific grades, we can see how ratings and costs vary. <br>

                    Notably, grades like "A" and "A+" cover a broader range of ratings and prices, suggesting that 
                    higher-rated food establishments may come with a premium. Meanwhile, lower grades like "C" and "D" 
                    tend to cluster in the lower price range, indicating that cheaper establishments often receive lower 
                    ratings. This visualization invites us to question whether higher prices correlate with better quality 
                    or if other factors influence student perceptions of value.

                <p> This is an interactive overview comparing the food rating -
                    a standardized review of their dining hall quality with a letter grade
                    ranging from D-A+ - of an institution to the change in their tuition fees over a five year
                    period. What we found is that overall, there is no significant correlation between
                    food rating and tuition increases over a five year period. <br>
                    For instance, insitutions with a D rating experienced average tuition increases of 4.5k over five years, while those
                    with a C, B, A, and A+ rating saw a 3.8k, 4.2k, 4.3k, and 4.6k increase respectivelly. <br>
                    So while the insitutions with the highest food rating did see the greatest tuition jump, there was
                    no significant trend in the variation between the different grades.

                <p> After examining the relationship between average tuition increase
                    and food rating, we wanted to further investigate the relationship by
                    examining the relationship with a series of scatter plots. Unlike the previous
                    visualization, this no longer evaluates the different buckets of food ratings by an 
                    average, but instead by displaying each instiution as a data point on the graph. What we discovered
                    is that the scatter plot reinofrced the conlcusion that there was no clear correlation between
                    a university's food rating and tuition increase over a five year period. What we found is that
                    each food rating similarly displayed a very wide range of tuition changes. As a result, it is 
                    apparent that the lack of correlation is not due to a sufficiently diverse selection of colleges, but 
                    because food rating is independent of the movement of tuition changes over a short term period.
