                <p> First, we have an interactive overview comparing the food rating -
                    a standardized review of their dining hall quality with a letter grade
                    ranging from D-A+ - of an institution to the change in their tuition fees over a five year
                    period. What we found is that overall, there is no significant correlation between
                    food rating and tuition increases over a five year period. For instance, insitutions with a 
                    D rating experienced average tuition increases of 4.5k over five years, while those
                    with a C, B, A, and A+ rating saw a 3.8k, 4.2k, 4.3k, and 4.6k increase respectivelly.
                    So while the insitutions with the highest food rating did see the greatest tuition jump, there was
                    no significant trend in the variation between the different grades.
                </p>
                <p class='text'> Overall, this indicates that other factors are more important in the determinance of a good food score,
                    which can include overall tuition, location, or student population over tuition change over a five year time 
                    period in particular.</p>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'image'>
                <iframe src="D3 Graph Project\Scatterplot\index.html" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> After examining the relationship between average tuition increase
                    and food rating, we wanted to further investigate the relationship by
                    examining the relationship with a series of scatter plots. Unlike the previous
                    visualization, this no longer evaluates the different buckets of food ratings by an 
                    average, but instead by displaying each instiution as a data point on the graph. What we discovered
                    is that the scatter plot reinofrced the conlcusion that there was no clear correlation between
                    a university's food rating and tuition increase over a five year period. What we found is that
                    each food rating similarly displayed a very wide range of tuition changes. As a result, it is 
                    apparent that the lack of correlation is not due to a sufficiently diverse selection of colleges, but 
                    because food rating is independent of the movement of tuition changes over a short term period.
