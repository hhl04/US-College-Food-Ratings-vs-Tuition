                As we dug into the data, a few clear patterns emerged, but we also found some surprising insights 
                that challenged our assumptions about food quality and college costs. <br>

                First, the relationship between food grades and ratings was as expected: higher grades like "A" 
                and "A+" came with better ratings, while lower grades tended to cluster around lower scores. 
                This makes sense — schools with stricter food quality standards seem to achieve higher ratings. 
                But when we looked at tuition, things got interesting. Intuitively, you might think schools with 
                sky-high tuition would also offer top-rated food. However, the data didn't back this up.
                 We found no firm link between tuition costs and food ratings. Schools charging over $80,000 didn't 
                 consistently deliver higher-rated food, suggesting that a hefty price tag doesn't necessarily mean 
                 better quality in the dining hall. <br>
                
                Looking at geographic patterns, we used a map to visualize food ratings by state, hoping to find regional 
                trends. While there were some differences in average ratings, there wasn't a striking pattern linking 
                certain regions to better food quality. It made me think about how factors like local culture or state 
                policies might subtly influence dining options, but they're probably not the whole story. <br>
                
                Lastly, we looked at how food ratings varied with city population size. Again, I expected larger, more 
                urban campuses to have better food due to more diverse vendor options or higher standards, but 
                that assumption didn't hold up either. Food quality seemed to be all over the map, regardless of the 
                city size or school tuition. <br>          
            </p>

            <p class="padding">
                Overall, this indicates that other factors are more important in the determinance of a good food score,
                which can include overall tuition, location, or student population over tuition change over a five year time 
                period in particular.
